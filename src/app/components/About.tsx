              Hello! I'm Fedi Bellakhel, a passionate software developer who enjoys
              building beautiful and functional applications. With expertise in fields like AI
              and web development, I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously
              learning to enhance my craft. I'm excited about exploring artificial intelligence (AI)
              and advancing my skills in software development.

          "Why be normal when you can be great?"
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
          Being normal is about staying within the boundaries of the ordinary, but greatness comes from constantly pushing those boundaries. For someone like me, driven by an insatiable curiosity and the desire to learn everything I can, the goal is not just to exist but to thrive. 
          <br /><br />
          I believe that true growth lies in challenging myself to master new skills, solve complex problems, and continuously evolve. My vision is to embrace every learning opportunity, to transform passion into expertise, and to inspire others by showing that greatness is within reach for those who relentlessly pursue it.
